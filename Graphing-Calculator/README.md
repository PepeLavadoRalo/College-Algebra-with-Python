## Scripts Overview

### `equation_plotter_with_zoom.py`
This script provides functionality for:
- Plotting one or more equations (e.g., `y = x**2`, `y = np.sin(x)`).
- Shading areas above or below the graph.
- Zooming into specific ranges of the plot.
- Interactively setting graph ranges or zoom factors.

### `math_system_solver.py`
This script includes tools for:
- Plotting a single equation and displaying its value table.
- Solving systems of linear equations.
- Graphing two equations and finding their intersection points.
- Solving and graphing quadratic equations, including marking roots and the vertex.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. The scripts use the following libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `sympy`

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib sympy
```
## How to use

### equation_plotter_with_zoom.py

Run the script:
```bash
python equation_plotter_with_zoom.py
```
Follow the on-screen menu to:
Plot equations with optional shading.
Solve and plot quadratic equations.
Adjust the graph's zoom level interactively.

### math_system_solver.py

Run the script:
```bash
python math_system_solver.py
```
Use the menu options to:
Graph equations and display value tables.
Solve systems of linear equations.
Graph two equations and display their intersection point.
Solve and graph quadratic equations.
